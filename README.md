# Arcade

## How to use

SFML must be installed in `/usr/local/` and ncurses installed wherever you want.

To install Arcade, just use the command `make` and then launch the menu in **SFML** : `./arcade lib/lib_arcade_sfml.so` or in **ncurses** : `./arcade lib/lib_arcade_ncurses.so`

If it doesn't work in SFML, you will need to export the library path : `export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/usr/local/SFML/lib`
